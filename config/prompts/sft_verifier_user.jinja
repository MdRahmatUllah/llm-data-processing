Verify the following candidate SFT training item against the source material and quality criteria.

**Candidate Item:**
```json
{{ candidate_json }}
```

**Source Context:**
- Project: {{ chunk_meta.project }}
- File: {{ chunk_meta.file_name }}
- Chunk Index: {{ chunk_meta.chunk_index }}
- Chunk ID: {{ chunk_meta.chunk_id }}

**Source Text:**
```
{{ chunk_text }}
```

**Verification Criteria:**

1. **Content Consistency:**
   - All facts, concepts, and information in the problem and solution must be present in the source text
   - No hallucinations or external knowledge introduced
   - The question is answerable using only the source material

2. **Structure Validation:**
   - The solution contains properly paired <|begin_of_thought|> ... <|end_of_thought|> tags
   - The solution contains properly paired <|begin_of_solution|> ... <|end_of_solution|> tags
   - These tag pairs appear in the correct order (thought section before solution section)
   - All opening tags have corresponding closing tags

3. **Answer Format:**
   - If the problem requires a mathematical or definitive answer, the solution must contain \boxed{...}
   - The boxed answer (if present) is correct and matches the reasoning

4. **Quality Standards:**
   - The problem is clear and well-formed
   - The solution demonstrates proper reasoning
   - The reasoning is logical and follows from the source material
   - The final answer is correct based on the source text

**Your Task:**

Evaluate the candidate item against ALL criteria above. Respond with a JSON object in this exact format:

```json
{
  "passed": true or false,
  "errors": ["list of specific error messages if failed, empty array if passed"],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your decision"
}
```

**Important:**
- Set "passed" to true ONLY if the item meets ALL criteria
- If any criterion fails, set "passed" to false and list specific errors
- Be strict but fair in your evaluation
- Focus on factual accuracy and structural correctness

Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include markdown code fences or any other text.
