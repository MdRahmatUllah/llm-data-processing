You are generating {{ n }} high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) examples based on the following source material.

**Source Context:**
- Project: {{ project }}
- File: {{ file_name }}
- Chunk Index: {{ chunk_index }}
- Chunk ID: {{ chunk_id }}

**Source Text:**
```
{{ chunk_text }}
```

**Instructions:**

1. Generate exactly {{ n }} diverse question-answer pairs based ONLY on the information in the text above.
2. Do NOT introduce facts, concepts, or information not present in the source text.
3. Each example must follow this structure:
   - A user message containing a question, problem, or task request
   - An assistant message containing the complete response with reasoning

4. The assistant's response MUST include properly delimited sections:
   - <|begin_of_thought|> ... <|end_of_thought|> wrapping the reasoning process
   - <|begin_of_solution|> ... <|end_of_solution|> wrapping the final answer or solution
   - Both opening and closing tags are REQUIRED for each section

5. Return your response as a JSON array of objects with this exact schema:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "problem": "The user's question or task",
       "solution": "The complete assistant response including <|begin_of_thought|> reasoning <|end_of_thought|> <|begin_of_solution|> final answer <|end_of_solution|>"
     }
   ]
   ```

6. **CRITICAL - JSON Escaping Rules:**
   - Escape ALL backslashes as \\\\ (double backslash)
   - Use only valid JSON escape sequences: \\", \\\\, \\/, \\n, \\r, \\t, \\b, \\f, \\uXXXX
   - Never use invalid escapes like \\x, \\a, \\v, or single backslash before letters
   - No trailing commas after the last item in arrays or objects

7. Ensure variety in:
   - Question types (factual, analytical, comparative, explanatory)
   - Difficulty levels (simple recall to complex reasoning)
   - Focus areas (different aspects of the source material)

**Output Format:**
Return ONLY the JSON array. Do not include markdown code fences, explanations, or any other text.

**Example of Properly Escaped JSON:**
```json
[
  {
    "problem": "What is the file path?",
    "solution": "<|begin_of_thought|>\\nThe path is C:\\\\Users\\\\Documents\\\\file.txt\\n<|end_of_thought|>\\n<|begin_of_solution|>\\nThe answer is \\\\boxed{C:\\\\Users\\\\Documents\\\\file.txt}\\n<|end_of_solution|>"
  }
]
```
